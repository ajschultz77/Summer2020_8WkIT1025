# Executive Summary
* Type your executive summary as if you were explaining your lab on an IT team

The purpose of this executive summary is to demonstrate the IT team how to use github in lab 1. It allows groups of developers to collaborate on the same documents (often source code) simultaneously and without over-riding each other’s work.

**A GitHub workflow can be condensed into Branching** - *Commits - Pull Requests - Collaboration - Merge. 

*Being able to navigate, create a folder(s), screen capture and upload an image on github.*

*This way information can be shared privately or public.*

# Information System Components  

* Take the example of ATM that we use everyday. Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in the system you identified with respect to the ATM.

The **hardware** components of an ATM uses the following: *display screens*, *speakers*, *receipt printers*, *cash dispensers*, *key pads* and *card readers*.

The **software** of an ATM can use many different kinds. XFS platforms use the following: *Triton PRISM"*, *Diebold Agilis EmPower* and *NCR APTRA Edge*.

**Data** is collected by *an electronic banking outlet that allows customers to complete basic transactions without the aid of a branch representative or teller. Anyone with a credit card or debit card can access cash at most ATMs and that's how data can be collected*.

**People** *can withdraw and deposit money from the ATM anywhere. Sometimes fees might apply to non-members of the ATM, but can still deposit or withdraw*.

The **process** of an *ATM card is entered into the ATM – PIN is entered – Amount is entered for withdrawal. ATM dials the appropriate network (Star, Presto, Plus, Cirrus, etc.) The appropriate network then contacts the customer's financial institution to verify funds*.

# Github

* In GitHub you are experiencing a "Client-Server" architecture.  Explain what is meant by "client-server" architecture and how GitHub fits this model. 

**Client Server Architecture** *is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client. This type of architecture has one or more client computers connected to a central server over a network or internet connection. This system shares computing resources*. 

**Github fits this model** *by networking projects which creates Client-Server architecture for multiple clients using different computer coding*.

* Why is GitHub considered "Cloud Computing?" What other "cloud computing" environments do you use?

**Github is a cloud-based source code management or version control system that is like a social networking site for programmers.GitHub is an open environment where programmers can freely share and collaborate on open source code with the public or private audience group(s)**.

**Cloud computing examples I use**: *Linkedln, Facebook, Gmail, Outlook, Salesforce and Huntington Bank*.

# Conclusion
In this section you might discuss future considerations (what you might want to learn more about), issues that you encountered (remember you may decide to post your repo link on LinkedIn or provide to a future employer so be sure to keep your discussion professional) and/or your impressions of the lab components.

**In conclusion,** *I want to be able to show employers a portfolio of the work I've completed and demonstrate that I am capable of coding, posting and manipulating informatin on Github. Having collaboration and showing the methods will greatly benefit my future enddeavors in IT.*
